Marc Jacobs is the ultimate shape-shifter of fashion. From grunge to glamour, avant-garde to effortless cool, his designs have continually pushed boundaries while remaining undeniably wearable.

In 1992, Jacobs shook the industry with his iconic grunge collection for Perry Ellis, sending models like Kate Moss down the runway in flannel, slip dresses, and combat boots—only to be fired for it. The collection, however, became legendary, proving that Jacobs was always ahead of his time.
