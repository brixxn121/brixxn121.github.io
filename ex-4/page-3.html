    <b>Introduction to Variants:</b>While Texas Hold'em is the most popular poker variant, the world of poker offers a diverse range of games. Here are a few intriguing variants to consider:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Omaha Hold'em:</b> Similar to Texas Hold'em, but players receive four hole cards, and they must use exactly two of them to form their hand.</li>
            <li><b>Seven Card Stud:</b>Players receive seven cards, and the goal is to form the best five-card hand. Betting rounds follow each card dealt.</li>
            <li><b>Five Card Draw:</b>Each player is dealt five private cards, and they can exchange some or all of them for new cards in an attempt to improve their hand.</li>
            <li><b>Razz:</b> A lowball variant where the goal is to have the lowest possible hand. Straights and flushes don't count, and Aces are low.</li>
            <li><b>Pineapple and Crazy Pineapple:</b>Variants of Hold'em where players receive three hole cards, but in Crazy Pineapple, one card must be discarded after the flop.</li>
            <li><b>Stud High-Low:</b>A split-pot variant of Seven Card Stud where the highest and lowest hands share the winnings.</li>
        </ol>
